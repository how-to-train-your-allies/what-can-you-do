# What Can You Do?
The aim of this booklet is to provide practical guidance for those wishing to do more in their department to support gender diversity. It is not an exhaustive list, and we hope that this is a starting point for most to actively continue their learning about what they can do.

## Introduction

This booklet is a collaboration between our group and the Piscopia Initiative. The advice has come from Rosie Evans's experience as co-lead of Piscopia; the How to Train Your Allies group's collective involvement in Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committees; several academics; and the Piscopia community across the UK. The aim is that this booklet be made available online and to seek funding to print physical copies for distribution. If you would like to print physical copies, please get in touch with us so that we can keep track of the impact this booklet has had! Similarly, if you find this booklet helpful or have recommendations for future versions, please email us:

[howtotrainyourallies@gmail.com](mailto:howtotrainyourallies@gmail.com) and [piscopiainitiative@gmail.com](mailto:piscopiainitiative@gmail.com)

Please appreciate that both initiatives that worked to create this booklet are made up of volunteers and so our response may be slow.
