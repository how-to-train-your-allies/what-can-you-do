	<li><h3 class="A"><i>Contextualising the maths</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">Lots of maths modules have some reference to the mathematicians that contributed to that particular area of maths. Here are a few suggestions on how to contextualise the maths in your course.</p>

<p class="B">Firstly, collate information about which mathematicians are referenced in your course. There is a template on the next page to aid with this. Then consider the following...</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Are the mathematicians <b>predominantly one gender or nationality</b>? If one group dominated an area of research, you can acknowledge this at the start of the course.</p></li>
	<li><p class="A">If there are <b>mathematicians from underrepresented groups</b> responsible for findings in your module, make sure to highlight this! If not, are there opportunities to include some?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="B">Read about the QMUL booklet in our hall of fame as a starting point!</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Was any research <b>wrongly attributed</b> to another mathematician? Were certain groups excluded from mathematical circles at the time?</p></li>
	<li><p class="A"><b>Give a few facts</b> about the mathematicians, which could be fun or sometimes gruesome! It makes the content memorable but also opens up discussion about the ethical considerations of the field.</p></li>
</ul>
