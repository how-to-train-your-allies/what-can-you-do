<h2 class="A">A Word on Accessibility</h2>

<p class="A"><i>Now there is definitely a whole booklet’s worth of content that we could write on accessibility. We note a few starting points here.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Lecture Notes</h3></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Mathematical notes (particularly those written in LaTeX) are very difficult for screen readers to interpret. Try to have all materials available in both PDF and HTML format in advance of the lectures so that students can adapt them for their own needs (for example, increasing or changing the font). Also make sure text is left-aligned for readability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="B">See the resource list in our hall of fame for help with this!</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Where possible, include a range of resource types such as physical models and videos as well as lecture notes. Use highly contrasting colours for slides and diagrams.</p></li>
	<li><p class="A">On lecture capture, make sure there are transcripts or closed captions. Similarly, have alt text on pictures and make sure links in notes are descriptive.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Extra Support</h3></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Provide platforms for students to anonymously and privately ask questions. For example, hand out small pieces of paper for people to write questions on during a lecture. You can then identify common problems and hear from students who wouldn’t be able to raise their hand in lectures.</p></li>
</ul>
