<h2 class="A">Hall of Fame</h2>

<p class="A"><i>Here we highlight some useful resources and systems that have already been made to help you implement some of our suggestions.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Diversifying the Maths Curriculum</h3></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">A project at Queen Mary University of London led by Dr Claudia Garetto created a document containing 56 biographies of prominent mathematicians with an emphasis on mathematicians from minority groups. The booklet has a handy contents page which organises the biographies by topic for easy navigation. Make sure to consider this as a starting point for your research and analyse how much you should take as ‘fact’. After all, history is often written by the winners!</p></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">DBS: Disclosure and Barring Service</h3></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Some roles, such as those involving outreach activities in schools or with young people, may require a DBS check. Transgender applicants can <b>contact the DBS Sensitive Team</b> (0300 131 2784) <b>before submitting an application</b> to choose not to have any gender or name information disclosed on their DBS certificate or to their employer, that could reveal their previous gender identity.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">PDF to HTML</h3></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A">Some helpful tools for LaTeX to HTML converting include pandoc, LatexML and BookML. Information on BookML installation and usage is at <a href="https://vlmantova.github.io/bookml/">https://vlmantova.github.io/bookml/</a> and there is a how to video at <a href="https://talmo.uk/2025/accessible-mathematics.html">https://talmo.uk/2025/accessible-mathematics.html</a></i></p></li>
