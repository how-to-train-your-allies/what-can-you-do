<h1 class="A">What Can You Do?</h1>
<h2 class="A">...conference organiser</h2>

<p class="A"><i>This section is primarily based on how we have run previous PiFORUM conferences.</p>

<p class="A">Our overarching ethos with PiFORUM is to celebrate collaboration and cooperation over competition. We recommend reading Eugenia Cheng’s book “x+y: A Mathematician's Manifesto for Rethinking Gender” (2020), which talks in more detail about what she coins as “congressive” and “ingressive” behaviours.</i></p>

<p class="B"><b>"The most comfortable I’ve felt at a conference. The community atmosphere was lovely!"</b></p>

<p class="A"><i>Often conferences will boast a 50/50 split of women and men speakers, but we believe that a lot of the feeling of belonging is in the smaller details of a conference. A lot of our attendees have given us positive feedback on the organisation of our conferences and how that has helped them feel at ease and really welcome.</p>

<p class="A">Below we talk about some “easy wins”; they are all simple measures that have had a positive impact on our conferences. All but one are free to implement (and the remaining one is very cheap)!</p>

<p class="B">If your event is inclusive by design, it will encourage a more diverse audience. See our further reading list for more suggestions.</p>

<h1 class="B">Before the Conference...</h1>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Provide Facilities Info</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We provided details on <b>where to find toilets</b> (including gender-neutral ones) and booked a spare room as a <b>quiet space</b> that people could use if they needed. We provided all these details beforehand via email and in a conference booklet so attendees didn’t have to ask!</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Dress Code</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">On our website and via email, we provided recommendations for what to wear. On social media we shared pictures of what we were wearing as organisers, meaning attendees could see an actual face before they arrive which made things more welcoming too.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Caring Costs</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">Make sure to include caring costs when you apply for funding for an event, and that this is then advertised when you promote your event! As an idea of the amount, for PiFORUM24 we requested a few hundred pounds for an approximately 60-person, 2-day event.</p>

<p class="B">Ask your peers/colleagues what they wish they had known before attending their first conference, so that you can ease potential worries for first time attendees.</p>

<hr>

<h1 class="B">During the Conference...</h1>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Optional Pronoun Stickers</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We bought pronoun stickers (they are very cheap) that attendees could add to their name badge upon arrival should they wish to. This allowed people to choose on the day, it made registration more welcoming and friendly and people can update their choice throughout the conference (as they may not feel comfortable to do so initially).</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Preferred Names</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We asked all attendees if they had a preferred name and how to pronounce their name so that chairs would introduce speakers correctly.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Question Time</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We asked all speakers to hang back at the end of their session so that attendees could ask them questions individually instead of in front of a crowd. This measure also encourages more meaningful interactions for speakers.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Social Activity</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We also have a (sober) social activity at the same venue as the conference to allow for more people to attend and network which accommodates for those with caring or other responsibilities and limits worries about travelling home late in an unfamiliar area.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A">Doing Prizes Differently</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">We awarded lots of prizes at PiFORUM that rewarded collaborative and inquisitive behaviours. For example, we gave out a prize to someone for asking the most interesting questions, another for networking the most with multiple groups, another for enthusiastic participation in the workshops and another for particularly clear figures in a presentation.</p>
