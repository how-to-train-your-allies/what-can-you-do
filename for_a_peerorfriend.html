<h2 class="A">...for a peer or friend</h2>

<p class="A"><i>This section covers actions you can implement at any stage in your career.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><h3 class="A"><i>Modelling behaviour</h3></li>
</ul>
<p class="A">Here we list some easy wins that you can implement straight away. We consider allyship an ongoing practice, so remember to return to this list regularly/research other allyship advice to action throughout your career. Your sphere of influence will change depending on your role, so think about how and who your actions could benefit in each.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><p class="A"><b>Making sure everyone is invited</b> to study groups, post seminar discussions, lunches, etc. Often, exclusion can happen informally over time. Think about whether the location of discussion is inviting for everyone (for example, catering to dietary restrictions).</p></li>
	<li><p class="A"><b>Supporting and promoting existing initiatives</b> (like us!). An oldie but a goodie. And you can support in more ways than just forwarding emails. If you have an event (e.g. a careers fair or staff training day), organise a rep from one of these initiatives to visit! Similarly, reach out to the initiative to tell them that you are promoting them locally, as this recognition is really valued by small initiatives.</p></li>
	<li><p class="A"><b>If you hear about a prize, think about whether anyone in your department might be appropriate for nomination.</b> Even if they don’t win, passing the info on or saying that you nominated them is a good confidence boost for anyone!</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1 class="B">Reflections</h1>
<p class="B">Identify colleagues within your department that you could go to if you witness unacceptable behaviour. By creating a ‘safe’ group, you are supporting an environment where you feel confident in reporting inappropriate behaviour without repercussions.</p>
<p class="B">Specify your pronouns in email signatures, online calls and public profiles so that it becomes more normalised.</i></p>
